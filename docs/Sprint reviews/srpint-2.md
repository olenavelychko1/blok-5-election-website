# Sprint 2
On October 9 2025, we had a sprint review with our product owner. This is the feedback we received:

Feedback:
- Nice frontend (nav, footer, home page).
- Show more data on the frontend, separate pages.
- More backend.
- User stories in sprint 3 about forum/login will come later.

For the next sprint (3):
- Show more data on the frontend:
- Tables, graphs, percentages, etc.
- Search by party, postal code (search function).
- Show accessibility (Thomas).
- Show short ethics report.
- Compare with different years.
