# Sprint 1
On September 18, 2025, we had a sprint review with our product owner. This is the feedback we received:

- Keep the homepage small
- Check the color pattern (ethics) accessibility
- Navbar on the login and register pages
- Election results: handle invalid results, and when clicking on a party, show a short description
- "Must have 4" is an epic – break it down into smaller parts
- Add the Definition of Done (DoD) to every user story
- Create an ethics user story for everyone
- Mai needs to talk more and take more initiative in the upcoming sprint reviews

*What went well?* 
- Personas were approved
- Requirements
- Design document
- Design was good, except for a few points (mentioned in the feedback above)
- Lena, Daan and Thomas did well with taking part in the sprint review and asking questions

These points went well.
