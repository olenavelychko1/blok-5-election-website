### Daan
- found svg map of the Netherlands
- applied feedback from Lena on the national votes transformer

### Lena
- no progress. Was feeling too overwhelmed due to the stress from the amount of work.
  Feedback from Thomas: do research yourself for 15 minutes and ask more questions if you don't understand something, instead of spending an hour in confusion.
