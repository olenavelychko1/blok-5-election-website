## Scrum Poker

In this scrum poker session we are going to choose the issues for sprint 2 and
assign points to it. The points are as follows:

0: quick fix (5 min)
1: 1 hour
3: couple of hours
5: half a day
8: a day
13: just more then a day
21: more then a day (issue should probably be split up)

## User story examples
### Homepage
At the user story for the homepage we had different points (1, 3, 3, 5).
We talked about it said 3 would be the best option.

### Filter Election

We had the points (5, 8, 8, 13). After talking about all the things we needed to do
like documentating, testing, date retrieval we finished with 13 points.
