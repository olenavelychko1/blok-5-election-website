## Scrum poker

In this scrum poker session we are going to choose the issues for sprint 3 and estimate points to them.

The points are as follows:
0: quick fix (5 min)
1: 1 hour
3: couple of hours
5: half a day
8: a day
13: just more then a day
21: more then a day (issue should probably be split up)
